## Runtime Configuration

We utilize a Vue plugin `RuntimeConfiguration` to configure a web application using environment variables without rebuilding it.

See [runtime-config-template.js](./src/utils/runtimeconfig/runtime-config-template.js) for all available runtime variables.

### Usage

Normally, you would use `process.env` to consume environment specific configuration. This changes here.
To consume environment variables in a Vue component, use `this.$env` as you would use `process.env`.

#### Example

```
this.$env.MATOMO_URL // Formerly process.env.MATOMO_URL
```

`this.$env` differs from `process.env` in a way that some properties that are set using environment variables are set here. That means that in a development environment, `this.$env` would be equivalent to `process.env`.

### Creating new runtime variables

If you want to make configuration properties dynamic during runtime using environment variables, follow these steps:

1. In [runtime-config-template.js](./src/utils/runtimeconfig/runtime-config-template.js), add your desired configuration variable as a property and enter its enivronment variable name as value. However, there are some restrictions you must follow:
    -  Environment variable names in [runtime-config-template.js](./src/utils/runtimeconfig/runtime-config-template.js) must have the prefix `$VUE_APP_`.
    -  Ensure that the property you want to replace during runtime is consistent in its name *and* structure.
2.  Build and deploy the application.
3.  Set your environment variable *without* the dollar sign `$` at the beginning. For example, if your new entry in [runtime-config-template.js](./src/utils/runtimeconfig/runtime-config-template.js) is `MATOMO_URL: '$VUE_APP_MATOMO_URL'`, make sure you set the environment variable `VUE_APP_MATOMO_URL`.
4.  Your  variable is now ready for consumption and can be changed during runtime by changing their associated environment variable.

#### Example

Let's suppose `process.env` looks like this (depending on how the project is set up):
```
{
  NODE_ENV: 'production',
  ROOT_API: 'https://www.europeandataportal.eu/metrics',
  ROOT_URL: 'https://www.europeandataportal.eu',
  MATOMO: {
      API_URL: 'https://www.ppe-aws.europeandataportal.eu/piwik/',
      ID: 89
  }
}
```

and you want to change `ROOT_API`, `MATOMO.API_URL`, and `MATOMO.ID` during runtime. Let's go through the steps outlined above:

1.  [runtime-config-template.js](./src/utils/runtimeconfig/runtime-config-template.js), would look like this:
```
export default {
  ROOT_API: '$VUE_APP_ROOT_API',
  MATOMO_URL: {
      API_URL: '$VUE_APP_MATOMO_API_URL',
      ID: '$VUE_APP_MATOMO_ID'
  }
}
```
2.  Build and deploy.
3.  Now set the environment variables. These are: `VUE_APP_ROOT_API`, `VUE_APP_MATOMO_API_URL`, and `VUE_APP_MATOMO_ID`.
